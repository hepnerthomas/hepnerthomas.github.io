Instead, incremental funds have been invested in the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) and Index Cooperative (INDEX). On December 12th, I invested ~2% of the BEST Portfolio in DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) and ~1% in Index Cooperative (INDEX).</li>

                            <p>I have multiple Bitcoin t-shirts, had a Bitcoin bumper sticker on my car for a year, own and run a Casa Bitcoin Node (you probably don’t know what this is), read obsessively about Bitcoin on #cryptotwitter, and talk about it every chance I can get with friends, family, and even coworkers. </p>
                            <p>The question I hear from people the most about my obsession is, <span class="quote">“How many Bitcoins do you have?”</span> I cannot help but laugh when some of the most polite, socially considerate people I’ve ever met are essentially asking me a question that is the equivalent of, <span class="quote">“How much money do you have in your bank account?”</span> It could be considered rude if it were not so bizarre. </p>
